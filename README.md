## Datasets We Used
* We used a city traffic signs dataset which is an inventory of signs that the Department of Public Works updates when new signs are added to the City of Pittsburgh. It specifies the types of signs and where they are places in the city. The link to the dataset is https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-traffic-signs
