## Datasets We Used
* We used a city traffic signs dataset which is an inventory of signs that the Department of Public Works updates when new signs are added to the City of Pittsburgh. It specifies the types of signs and where they are places in the city. The link to the dataset is https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-traffic-signs

* We used a tree dataset which is an index of trees in Pittsburgh and maintained by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works Forestry Division. The dataset provides the location of each tree along with its affect on the environment. The link to the dataset is https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees

## Overview
* This repository is our work for a project where we decide what neighborhood in the City of Pittsburgh is best for Panthers to live in.
