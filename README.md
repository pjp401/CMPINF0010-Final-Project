## Datasets We Used
* We used a city traffic signs dataset which is an inventory of signs that the Department of Public Works updates when new signs are added to the City of Pittsburgh. It specifies the types of signs and where they are places in the city. The link to the dataset is https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-traffic-signs

* We used a dataset that had the water features of pittsburgh maintained by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works that includes all of the water features that it maintains in public areas. The link to this dataset is https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/513290a6-2bac-4e41-8029-354cbda6a7b7
* I also used a dataset that had the amount of spray parks and pools in the city, including data on their location and who operates them. The link to this dataset is https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/5cc254fe-2cbd-4912-9f44-2f95f0beea9a


* We used a tree dataset which is an index of trees in Pittsburgh and maintained by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works Forestry Division. The dataset provides the location of each tree along with its affect on the environment. We used this to dataset to determine how green a neighborhood is. The link to the dataset is https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees


* We used a dataset of local cat shelters. As there was no such publicly maintained dataset for this we used google maps to determine location of cat shelters in Pittsburgh.

## Overview
* This repository is our work for a project where we decide what neighborhood in the City of Pittsburgh is best for Panthers to live in.
